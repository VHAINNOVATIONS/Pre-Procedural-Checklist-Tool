# Pre-Procedural-Checklist-Tool
VHA Innovation Project ID # 104
-------------------------------

Healthcare requires coordination of multiple people and many pieces of information, especially in preparation for procedural events, such as magor operations.  Much data exists in VistA/CPRS but displays of the 'pre-procedure status' of a patient are limited to a single author, date/time-based text (TIU) information, rather than event-based or task-based information.  The Pre-Procedure Checklists innovation created a checklist tool that can be refreshed and completed by multiple users in anticipation of a procedural event.
